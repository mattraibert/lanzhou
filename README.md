Lanzhou(兰州市) is famous for its beef noodles made with noodles that are stretched by hand from a single ball of dough. When I do my stretching routine, I often think about my muscles being hand-pulled noodles. This application will help you set complex timers for your stretching routine.

Watch a short documentary about Lanzhou noodles here: [Noodle School](https://vimeo.com/288573585).

To use the app, first edit `exercises.csv` to fill in your routine. Then run `./pt_train.rb` and start stretching your noodles.
